## Learning Git: Cloning a GitHub Repository

One of the first things I learned while working on my portfolio was how to clone a GitHub repository to my local machine. Cloning allows me to work on a project locally while also keeping it synced with the repository on GitHub.

### Steps I followed to clone a GitHub repository:

1. **Create an empty repository on GitHub**: I started by creating a new repository on GitHub to hold my portfolio project.
2. **Copy the repository URL**: From my GitHub repository page, I copied the HTTPS URL for my project, which looks like this:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/username/my-Portfolio.git
   ```
